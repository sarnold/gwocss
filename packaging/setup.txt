gentoo/ has openrc init script and conf.d config file.

debian/ has config for /et/default (conf file is also used by shell script)

If you write a custom init script for another distro, you can source the conf
file and use the config variables in your script.  The init script doesn't
run anything persistent, but is used to setup the required directories and
permissions.  GWOCSS requires a writable "home" with the proper input and
output subdirectories (slcin and slicout).

Helper scripts and other tools are on the TODO list; see the docs and run the
demo config to see how it works.
