This is the GPL release of Winds On Critical Streamline Surfaces (GWOCSS), 
a diagnostic windfield model for complex terrain.  It can be used for both 
objective analysis (with physics and terrain) of observational data and as 
a way to downscale prognostic model output (ie, to obtain finer resolution 
winds from a coarser grid model output).

Consult the INSTALL file to learn how to build and install binaries of 
GWOCSS.  Note: in spite of what the above file says, you must install 
GWOCCS by hand (make sure you create the required sub-directories).  
Basically, just cd into the top-level gwocss src directory and run:

$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure (autogen will run configure by default)
$ make

It should only require a basic toolchain, ie, autoconf and an F77 compiler. 
The FFLAGS are specific to gfortran, but the basic autoconf macros allow for 
several other Fortran compilers.  You can override the FFLAGS on the command 
line or edit src/Makefile.in if you're not using GNU Fortran.  Use the data 
and configuration included with the source to verify correct operation.  The
current code defaults to running in the parent directory of the input/output 
directories.

Please contact Steve Arnold <stephen.arnold42 _at_ gmail.com> for any questions
concerning this release.

USING GWOCSS:

The basic setup is to use the slcin and slcout directories for the
default input and output files; legacy Fortran directory names have 
been converted to lowercase, but not the filenames:

slcin/RUNSTF1.DAT - runtime configuration and localization parameters,
                    with sample data deafults (location near Salt Lake
		    City, UT).

slcin/SLC1KM.DAT - Topographic grid (1 km spacing) for above location.

slcin/SLCFILES - names of input files (meteorlogical data, only one file
                 for the sample problem).  See the next file...

slcin/10162215WXIN - Input meteorological data, can contain both surface
                     stations and upper air profiles.

inc/NGRIDS.PAR - Grid parameters and filename & path sizes.

inc/* - Fortran common include files.

The file GWOCSS_overview.pdf contains details on the sample problem, 
as well as the format for the input meteorological data file(s).  Note 
the changes mentioned at the top of the document; the files provided 
for the sample problem are the current (correct) format (you can also 
read the source code).  Also, please ignore the Matlab references...
